I used the script update_context_daily.rb to fetch the file from 
Pragma and convert it into a revision in git. But I manually switched 
the following line on and off: 
commit_to_git("beta", File.join($ver_path, 'beta'), $git_path) 

I used the script convert_from_gitorious_to_new_repo.rb to fetch 
revisions from the gitorious repository, modify them and import them 
to the repository (as long as the gitorious repository was alive). 

What needs to be done now is the following: 

- list versions available in our git repository 
- list versions available in Taco's archive 
- determine what to take from which one based on what's present and 
what's missing 

- either rewrite my script from scratch or modify it, so that it will 
fetch every Taco's file, extract it and commit it to git (with proper 
date & committer set)
